1. Open a terminal in the project root (`c:\Users\tourg\Desktop\SANTIS_SITE`).
   ```
   cd "c:\Users\tourg\Desktop\SANTIS_SITE"
   ```
2. // turbo
   Run a simple HTTP server on port 8080.
   ```
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```
3. Open your default browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the site.
   - If you use VS Code, you can also click **Go Live** (Live Server extension) which does the same.
4. When you are done, stop the server (Ctrl +C in the terminal) and close the browser tab.

**Tip:** Keep the terminal open while you edit files; the page will auto‑refresh when you save changes.
