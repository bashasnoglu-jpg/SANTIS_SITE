# ROLE: Recovery Specialist

# MISSION: UNHIDE QUARANTINE & RESTORE FILES
The user needs to access the `_KARANTINA_NEUROVA` folder because some active project files might have been moved there by mistake, or they need to retrieve assets.

## ACTION PLAN:

### 1. UNHIDE THE FOLDER (REVERSE VISIBILITY)
- **Target:** `.vscode/settings.json`
- **Action:** REMOVE the lines that exclude `_KARANTINA_NEUROVA` from `files.exclude` and `search.exclude`.
- **Result:** The folder must reappear in the VS Code file explorer sidebar immediately.

### 2. RESTORE CRITICAL FILES (RESCUE MISSION)
- **Check:** Look inside `_KARANTINA_NEUROVA`.
- **Action:** If you find any of the following files inside the quarantine, **MOVE THEM BACK TO ROOT (./)** immediately:
    - `index.html`
    - `styles.css`
    - `script.js`
    - `santis-hotels.json`
    - `README.md`
    - `.gitignore`

### 3. VERIFICATION
- List the files currently in the root directory to confirm the "Santis Club" project is active again.

# GOAL:
Make the quarantine folder visible again and restore the main project files if they were accidentally archived.
